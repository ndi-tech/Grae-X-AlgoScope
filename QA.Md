# Grae-X AlgoScope – QA & Testing

This project is currently in active development.
QA is lightweight and focused on manual validation and correctness.

## QA Goals
- Ensure core algorithm logic behaves as expected
- Validate input/output correctness
- Catch edge cases and unexpected failures early
- Improve stability before deeper optimization

## What to Test
- Algorithm behavior with normal inputs
- Edge cases (empty, extreme, invalid inputs)
- Performance assumptions (slowdowns, hangs)
- Output consistency and correctness
- Error handling and failure states

## How to Contribute QA
- Run the code locally
- Test scenarios related to recent changes
- Log findings as GitHub Issues

## Reporting Issues
Please include:
- What you were testing
- Input used
- Expected result
- Actual result
- Environment (OS, Python version)
